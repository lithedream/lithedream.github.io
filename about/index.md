title: About
---

I’m a software engineer with a long memory.

I’ve spent most of my professional life building and maintaining **real systems**: large Java backends, ERP modules, databases that actually matter, code that has to survive years.

I care about:
- **clarity over abstraction theater**
- **proximity of meaning** (logic close to where it’s used)
- tools that earn trust by being boring in the right places

## How I work

I prefer:
- explicit code over magic
- SQL written consciously, not hidden
- small libraries with sharp edges
- systems that can be reasoned about months later

I ship less, but I ship things I’m willing to put my name on.

## What this site is

This is a small public surface:
- a place to point to projects
- a place to anchor names and ideas
- a quiet alternative to social feeds

No blog schedule.  
No funnel.  
Just artifacts.
